# CIS130-Midcourse
This is the project I created for the midcourse exam in CIS130. 
The styling of this page was derived from the look of ivansservice.com. 
I did not want to consume too much time writing code for a complex look so I focused on finding images with high resolution and adding a shadow on top of them. 
The HTML code was provided so styling was the only thing that had to be done unless more html code was desired. 
The professor tied this project with another one for first place.
